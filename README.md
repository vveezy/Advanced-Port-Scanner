## üìù Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Advanced-Port-Scanner.git
    cd Advanced-Port-Scanner

2. Run the Port Scanner
To run the port scanner, use the following command format:

Basic Scan:

    python advanced_port_scanner.py <target-ip-or-hostname>

    
Custom Port Range:
Scan specific ports by specifying the start and end ports:

    python advanced_port_scanner.py <target-ip-or-hostname> -sp 1000 -ep 2000
Custom Timeout:
Set a custom timeout value in seconds to control how long the scanner waits for a connection before timing out:

    python advanced_port_scanner.py <target-ip-or-hostname> -t 1 -sp 1000 -ep 5000

üõ†Ô∏è Example Usage
# Scan default port range (1 to 65535) for the target `ad.samsclass.info`
    python advanced_port_scanner.py ad.samsclass.info

# Scan ports from 1000 to 2000 for the target `ad.samsclass.info`
    python advanced_port_scanner.py ad.samsclass.info -sp 1000 -ep 2000

# Scan ports from 1 to 100 with a custom timeout of 1 second

    python advanced_port_scanner.py ad.samsclass.info -t 1 -sp 1 -ep 100
